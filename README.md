A sample command-line dart compiler application with an entrypoint in `bin/`.

## How to use ?
- First change values of `dartBinPath` and `dartPath` in `/bin/dart_compiler_prototype.dart` to your flutter and dart sdk paths.
- Now only run `main` from `/bin/dart_compiler_prototype.dart` and see the magic !

### out put
- for now I tried to compile a simple 1 line dart app through dart compiler and extract `js` from it.
